 Gov Jobs is a native android government job searching app that allows you to see listing of government jobs opportunities around the USA.
 You can see the descriptions of each job and their requirements. You can also share jobs with others and filter jobs based on the location-zip code/city/state, salary, experience level and keywords.

Users can apply to any positions through the app. In addition, you can create a personal account which will allow you save jobs in as favorite locally and look at them later on.

Gov Jobs also comes with a widget that user can put on their home screen.
